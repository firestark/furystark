# Furystark V1

I want to be able to keep track of 4 schemes. One for leg day, one for shoulder day, one for chest day and one for back day. Each scheme consists of multiple exercises. An exercise has a name and an amount of sets with reps to perform. Next to the exercises on the scheme are placeholders where you may enter numbers which represents the amount of weight in KG you did the exercise for, for the applicable set denoted on the scheme. For each set number of the achieved weight in KG should be filled in.



*Example list of schemes*

- Chest Feb 2020
- Back Feb 2020
- Shoulders Feb 2020
- Legs Feb 2020



*Example schema*

| Exercise       | 1              | 2          |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Bench press    | 50, 60, 65, 70 | -, -, -, - |
| Dumbbell flys  | 16, 18, 20, 22 | -, -, -, - |
| Dumbbell press | 18, 20, 22, 24 | -, -, -, - |



The goal of Furystark V1 is to be able to track the progressions in weight of each exercise individually for each exercise repetition combination. For each day the exercise repetition combination is performed the achieved number for each set is shown.



*Example exercise set repetition day graph*


| Bench press (4x8) | Set 1          | Set 2 | Set 3 | Set 4 |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 19 Aug 2019       | 50, 60, 65, 70 | 60    | 65    | 70    |
| 26 Aug 2019       | 55             | 60    | 65    | 70    |





## Notes

When an exercise is performed and the achieved weight is filled in we need to save the date. We need that date to show in the *exercise set repetition day graph*
